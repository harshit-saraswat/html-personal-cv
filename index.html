        For the past few years I’ve been a lot of things- a student, a critique,
        an engineer, a developer, a designer, a planner, a manager and what not?
        But now it’s about time for me to step up my game and use my skills to
        give back to the society so as to help it develop in a better way. I’m a
        young software engineering graduate, who’s looking forward to work in a
        way that he is remembered.
